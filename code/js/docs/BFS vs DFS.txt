Comparison to BFS and DFS
------------------------
The implementation of depth-first search (DFS) is differentiated from bredth-first search (BFS) by implementing a queue system and adding new 
new nodes to the front of this queue. This results in nodes being explored 'depth-first' by following a node's path until it ends.
Bredth-first however searches nodes in the order they are discovered.

Example:
a - b 
a - c
b - d

DFS will search this network in this order: a-b, b-d, a-c
BFS will search this network in this order: a-b, a-c, b-d

This algorithm is  suited to avoiding loops because it follows a path until exhaustion, so can use this to remember the 
route and avoid visiting nodes it has visited before.

Critically, this variant of DFS is different however, in that it will back track when a node's predecessors haven't been fully searched yet.
This allows a propagation network to follow its path and accurately update values of nodes by changes in their predecessors.
